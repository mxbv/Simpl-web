# Simpl

## About
A minimalist journaling application designed to store and manage entries locally using localStorage. Simple, efficient, and always accessible without external dependencies.

## How it works
In this app you can create new entries, read, modify, and delete them. It uses localStorage and writes data to a single key. Using a single key simplifies data handling and makes it easy to add fields for entries without changing the storage structure. The app also allows you to export your journal to a TXT file for backup or sharing purposes.

## Let's do it together
The code is open source, and I will be glad if you add something new and useful to it. Thank you!
