### About

A minimalist notes application designed to store and manage notes locally using localStorage. 
Simple, efficient, and always accessible without external dependencies.

### How it works

In this app you can create new notes, read modify and delete. 
It uses localStorage, and writes data to a single key. 
Using a single key allows you to simplify data handling and easily add fields for notes without changing the storage structure. 

### Let's do it together. 

The code is open source and I will be glad if you add something new and useful to it. Thank you !
